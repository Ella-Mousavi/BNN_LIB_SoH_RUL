# History-Agnostic LIB SoH and RUL Estimation using BNN

This repository contains the official code for the paper:

"History-Agnostic Lithium-Ion Batteries State of Health and Remaining Useful Life Estimation Using Fusion-Based Bayesian Neural Network" 

ðŸ’¡ Proposed Methodology
The proposed framework operates in two stages: Offline Training and Online Prediction.

Feature Extraction: Ten interpretable Health Indicators (HIs) are extracted from a single charge-discharge cycle's voltage profile. This includes four novel HIs derived from the voltage-time derivative (dV/dt).

Model Training (Offline): Two separate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are trained on the extracted HI datasetâ€”one for SoH estimation and one for direct RUL prediction. The models are trained using the Bayes by Backpropagation (BBB) algorithm.

Prediction (Online): The trained models can take the 10 HIs from a single cycle of a new battery (with no known history) and instantly generate probabilistic SoH and RUL predictions with uncertainty bounds.
